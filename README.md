# Predicting-Housing-Prices-HarvardX-Capstone
In this project we run a linear regression model on a data set to understand the working of the housing market in metropolitan cities in india and predict prices.

## Introduction
This report is a part of the Choose your own project in the course, Harvard X: PH125.9x Data Science: Capstone.

In this project I have tried to develop a model to predict the housing prices in metropolitan areas of India. I have looked at the cities of Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai in India. In the analysis I have tried to evaluate how the prices are affected by various parameters such as, area, no. of rooms, amenities, location, state etc. The factors for consideration have been evolved through the preliminary analysis in the project. The data set used for the analysis is obtained from Kaggle, and is authored by Ruchi Bhatia. The data set can be downloaded from here; <https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/housing-prices-in-metropolitan-areas-of-india>
